Product Name: OTH - ONE TIME HANDSHAKE
Problem Statement:
The current authentication method using OTP (One-Time Password) has several shortcomings, including:
Time Delay in OTP Authentication: OTPs often introduce time delays, which can be inconvenient and affect user experience.
Failure in Low Network Zones: Users in areas with poor network connectivity may face difficulties receiving OTPs, rendering the authentication
process unreliable.
Only 6 Digits Creating High Possibility to Hack OTPs: The limited 6-digit format of OTPs increases the vulnerability to hacking attempts.
Immense Server Load: The traditional OTP authentication system places a heavy load on servers, which can be both costly and inefficient.
Solution:
OTH - ONE TIME HANDSHAKE offers an innovative approach to address these issues. Our solution introduces the following features:
USSD Triggered Offline Authentication: OTH allows for authentication via USSD, enabling offline verification and reducing the reliance on internet
connectivity.
QR-Based Multifactor Authentication System: OTH leverages QR codes as part of a multifactor authentication system, enhancing security and user
experience.
Rapid & Dynamic Security Standard: OTH establishes a dynamic security standard that is both rapid and adaptive to different scenarios.
High Efficiency Even in Low Network Zones: OTH is designed to operate efficiently in areas with low or unstable network connectivity, ensuring
reliable authentication.
Unbreachable Quad Level Security Assurance: OTH provides a robust security framework with four layers of protection, making it highly resistant to
breaches.
Unique Value Proposition (UVP):
OTH offers a range of unique features that distinguish it from traditional OTP systems:
Dynamic Prompt QR for Every Authentication: OTH generates unique QR codes for each authentication attempt, enhancing security by eliminating
the risk of replay attacks.
Authentication Done in Less Than a Second: OTH boasts rapid authentication, completing the process in under a second, improving user
experience.
Functions Without Internet: OTH ensures that authentication remains functional even in areas with no internet connectivity, broadening its usability.
Quad Level Custom Encryption Algorithm: The use of a custom encryption algorithm with four security layers guarantees unbreachable protection for
users.
Distinct APIs Enhance Security Standards: OTH provides distinct application programming interfaces (APIs) to reinforce security standards and
meet the needs of various use cases.
In summary, OTH - ONE TIME HANDSHAKE reimagines OTP-based authentication by offering a dynamic, rapid, and highly secure method. Its
adaptability to different network conditions and innovative features like dynamic QR prompts make it a significant advancement in authentication
technology, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.
